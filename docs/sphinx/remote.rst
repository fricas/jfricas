==============
Remote via SSH
==============
We can use *Jupyter* on any suitable client remotely by ``ssh tunneling`` 
and ``port forwarding``. 
::

   cmd='jupyter notebook --no-browser'
   ssh -L localhost:localport:remotehost:remoteport remoteuser@remotehost $cmd
   
For example, we may use the same standard port ``8888`` locally as well:
::

   ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 user@nowhere.com $cmd
   

Then, after entering your ``ssh`` password,
::

   [I 03:07:58.252 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /run/user/1001/jupyter/notebook_cookie_secret
   [I 03:07:58.501 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/kfp
   [I 03:07:58.502 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
   [I 03:07:58.502 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
   [I 03:07:58.502 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=cbf1e582d5b44eadc20cf1fcb806c07b4074fbf9f38e8f27
   [I 03:07:58.502 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
   [C 03:07:58.503 NotebookApp]

    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=cbf1e582d5b44eadc20cf1fcb806c07b4074fbf9f38e8f27&token=cbf1e582d5b44eadc20cf1fcb806c07b4074fbf9f38e8f27


the ``jupyter notebook`` will be started on the remote machine and the port will
be forwared to you, that is, open your browser and copy/paste the URL as 
suggested above or alternatively enter
::

    localhost:8888
    
and you will see something like

.. image:: pics/jupypw.png

If you enter the token (e.g. from the example above: 
cbf1e582d5b44eadc20cf1fcb806c07b4074fbf9f38e8f27), then you will arrive at 
the usual Jupyter home page and you may proceed as usual (note that the 
notebooks are stored remotely, so you have to use menu/download if you want them
locally).

Setting a Password
------------------
Instead of using tokens you may set a password_ to protect the server:
::

     jupyter notebook password
     
Details may be found in the official documentation: password_

.. _password: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html 
 
Caveats
-------
* X11 forwarding


Windows Users
-------------
Instead of ``ssh`` you can use ``plink`` or ``putty`` from PuTTy_. 
::

   C:\> plink -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 usr@host.dom 
   $ jupyter notebook --no-browser

However,
the ``ssh`` client provided by GitBASH_ for instance, works perfectly as well.

Script
------
Clearly, you can enter the commands into a bash script:
::

   #!/bin/bash

   #remote cmd
   cmd='jupyter notebook --no-browser'

   # ssh template
   #ssh -L localhost:localport:remotehost:remoteport remoteuser@remotehost
   
   ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 usr@host.dom $cmd 

   # more commands (after termination of jupyter)
